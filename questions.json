      "A": "It's impossible, AWS Lambda containers are created and destroyed every time they are called",
      "B": "They will move the database connection object outside of the function handler",
      "C": "They will use an ElastiCache cluster to proxy requests to the RDS DB instance",
      "D": "",
      "E": "",
      "Answer": "B",
      "Explanation": "By moving the database connection object outside of the function handler, the Lambda container can reuse the connection if the container is reused (warm start), reducing the number of new connections created and improving performance."

      "Q_No": 11,
      "Question": "Your Lambda function written in Node.js wants to connect to an RDS PostgreSQL database in your VPC. The Lambda function must use the Node.js driver for PostgreSQL to connect to the database. How do you bundle your Lambda function to add the dependencies?",
      "A": "Put the function and the dependencies in one folder and zip them together",
      "B": "Zip the function as-is with a package.json file so that AWS Lambda can resolve the dependencies for you",
      "C": "Zip the function and the dependencies separately and upload them in AWS Lambda as two parts",
      "D": "Upload the code through the AWS Console and upload the dependencies as a .zip",
      "E": "",
      "Answer": "A",
      "Explanation": "You should put the function and all its dependencies (including the Node.js PostgreSQL driver) together in one folder, and then zip this folder before uploading to AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda requires all dependencies to be included in the deployment package unless specifically handled by Lambda Layers or other advanced methods."

      "E": "",
      "Answer": "D",
      "Explanation": "The preferred and correct method is to upload all Lambda code as a .zip file to an S3 bucket. Then, you reference the S3 object from within the AWS::Lambda::Function block in your CloudFormation template. This allows CloudFormation to deploy the Lambda using the packaged code."

      "D": "Use an S3 bucket",
      "E": "",
      "Answer": "C",
      "Explanation": "The recommended way to store temporary files in AWS Lambda is to use the local directory /tmp. This directory is specifically designated for temporary storage, is cleared between invocations, and is limited in size (512MB by default). Files stored here are erased when the function execution ends."

      "C": "The Lambda function timeout is too low",
      "D": "",
      "E": "",
      "Answer": "A",
      "Explanation": "When a Lambda function fails to execute successfully, AWS automatically retries the invocation. This can cause multiple log entries with the same request ID in CloudWatch Logs, as the same event is retried and logged again."

      "Answer": "C",
      "Explanation": "AWS Lambda natively supports Go, Python, Node.js, and Java, but it does not natively support C++. C++ is not available as a native Lambda runtime, and running C++ code would require using a custom runtime or wrapping C++ binaries."
